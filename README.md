A mini-shop page which fetch data from https://fakestoreapi.com/ . It is built it in React Js and I also mixed material UI-Components and Tailwind for styling. I am pretty sure that material UI-Components I used are unessecary but it was a chance to understand and utilise them to get the experience.
