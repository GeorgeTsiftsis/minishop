A mini-shop page that fetches data from https://fakestoreapi.com/ . It is built in React Js and I also mixed material UI-Components and Tailwind for styling. I am pretty sure that the material UI-Components I used are pointless but it was a chance to understand and utilize them to get the experience. You could visit my mini-project at https://minishop-weld.vercel.app/
